  <h2><b>Sustainable Development Goals</b></h2>
  <p>
    <b>The United Nations established the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b> in <b>2015</b> as a set of <b>17 global objectives</b> to address the most pressing issues facing the world. These include access to healthcare and education, poverty, hunger, inequality, and climate change. 
    Every nation has a clear path for creating a better future thanks to the SDGs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every goal has particular objectives that direct countries in preserving the environment and raising people's standard of living.
    To ensure that no one is left behind, they promote collaboration, equity, and sustainable development. 
    The SDGs also emphasize the importance of strong community involvement and responsible leadership.
  </p>
  <p>
    In general, the SDGs are a common goal that the entire world hopes to accomplish by <b>2030</b>.
     They serve as a reminder to everyone that cooperation, responsible decision-making, and action toward a safer, healthier, and more sustainable future for all are what lead to progress.
